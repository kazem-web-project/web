background.jpg is used 

logo.final is used the other are not ok!

register.php is for sing up page and works now with the database
there is no problem to insert and 
check the inserted via a select statement.

I should turn off the notice of the php to make 
it neat.

1- index.html is the first page works with style.css
2- register.php is for the sign up works with sign_up_style.css



todo: 
- index.html should be in .php
- do redirection!
** at the start of each file there is a todo
